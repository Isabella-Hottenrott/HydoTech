Once again, I spent the morning and Nanjingnan station. Vanessa told me that it is the biggest train station in China. I realized how nice it was inside.\n\nThe train ride to Beijing was once again high-speed, meaning we travelled for only around 4 hours. \n\n![Nanjing Skyline from Train](/images/nanjingskyline.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIt was much colder in Beijing when we got out of the train, and I couldn't even imagine what Inner Mongolia would be like the next day. We drove straight to the hotel, where we were greeted by Mr. Gu. \n\n## Lunch and University \n\nFrom there, we went to have lunch by Tsinghua University. We had traditional noodels with lots of colourful veggies put in. \n\n![Noodles in Beijing](/images/beijingnoodles.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe stopped at the Tsinghua University gate to take pictures and go to the gift store. In front of us taking pictures were two boys. They had just started their first year of high school, but were already taking pictures in front of the University gate, in hopes of getting in there in the future. This just shows how competitive the school is. Mr. Gu said that around 50 people per province get in, so it is a bit different than US acceptance rates, as it depends who got above a certain curved point on the examinations. We then went into the gift store and I bought a big jacket for Inner Mongolia. My first twenty minutes outside in Beijing showed me that I might need it.\n\n![Person Taking Pictures in Wishful Thinking in Front of Tsinghua Gate](/images/tsinghuagate.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Forbidden City\n\nNext, we went to the Forbidden City. It was unbelievably big. It took Vanessa and I thirty minutes to walk straight across, even though we hardly stopped. And this didn't account for all the other edges and different corners there were to visit. I believe we likely only saw about 10%. I was in complete awe of the whole place. I was also completely freezing. I would have loved to see it in summer, so that I could have had more time to appreciate all the different corners. I was just so freezing cold there, despite my two big jackets, that I could hardly think straight. \n\n![Forbidden City](/images/forbiddencity.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nMr. Gu didn't book a ticket in time, so he wasn't let in. We met up with him afterwards and warmed up in a mall. We had Chagee Milk Tea and then walked around a bit. We decided it would be a good idea to buy gloves for the next day. Then, we went and visited popmar and played some games in the games room. At Popmart there were SO many people. I was so surprised by how many people were obsessed with these little dolls that you couldn't even choose to buy on your own. I suppose I understand how appealing the game of being involved in the collecting process is. Each of us got a doll, I chose the little prince doll. None of us got the doll we wanted.\n\n![Popmart Dolls](/images/popmart.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nNext, we went to play games in the pick-up hall. We bought 210 coins and only collected 7 dolls. We averaged ten tries per doll. I think we all realized we were pretty bad. It was a cool insight into things that Chinese people my age do, as we don't have this type of game in the US.\n\n![Vanessa Trying to Pick a Doll](/images/pick.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n## Dinner\n\nFor dinner, Mr. Gu, Vanessa and I went to an amazing barbeque place that Mr. Gu had previously visited with his friends. The restaurant was very small, and had a very local feel to it. The food was amazing. We ordered a bunch of different types of meat, and they were all so flavorful. This might have been my favorite meal during my time in China, just because the food was sooo good. It was a great way to end the day after being out in the cold for long.\n\n![Barbeque in Beijing](/images/bbq.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIt was also really great to be spending time with Vanessa and Mr. Gu. It gave me insight into my future work- I definitely aspire to have colleagues where I can have fun with them outside of work, and have a good relationship with them. I know that both of them work really hard and are very dedicated to their work, but it was nice to see that they also have fun together and can enjoy each other's company outside of work. I think that is really important for a good work environment and culture.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Travel to Beijing\n\nToday, Vanessa and I travelled to Beijing.
