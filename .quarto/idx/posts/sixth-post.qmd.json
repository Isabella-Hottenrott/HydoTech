It’s quite a machine, consuming CO2 and recycling its own heat. Seeing technology with that kind of prospect for the future was inspiring.\n\n## Stop 2: Manufacturing\n\nWe toured the assembly lines (a mix of full and partial automation) where they seal the controller PCBs. We walked through the vibration and environmental testing rooms—rigorous stuff.\n\n## The CVM Test\n\nFinally, we got our hands on the HydoTech CVM controller system I had studied the day before. Here is how the system flow worked:\n\n  * Distribution: Test voltage leads to probes connecting to the electrolyzer substrate.\n  * Conversion: Inside the controller, voltage is converted to a two-byte representation and biased upward (to avoid negatives).\n  * Transmission: Transmission: Data is sent via two CAN ports $\\rightarrow$ CAN-to-Ethernet gateway $\\rightarrow$ Modbus conversion $\\rightarrow$ Gateway.\n  * Cloud: Over the router, data goes via 5G to the server.\n\n\nWe validated the real-time data on the computer using a multimeter.\n\n![Probing the CVM Controller with a Multimeter](images/cvmtest.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Panda Cake and Japanese\n\nWe returned to Nanjing for a dinner with the whole crew: Yutong, Yubo, Mr. Gu, Muyi, and Vanessa.
