There was relatively strict security at the door, and my passport had only been accepted the day before. Students were coming into the gates of the campus for their first morning classes.\n\n![In front of the Tsinghua University Gate](/images/tsinghua.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe campus is massive and beautiful, with many trees and a large lake in the middle. We saw some sights that even I knew from the US- some famous buildings that I knew from pictures I had seen online. \n\nVanessa and I were both in Tsinghua University jackets, because we hadn't packed warm enough layers for the trip. Mr. Gu, on the other hand, didn'thave anything that was Tsinghua University branded, so it looked like we were the students, and he was just a visitor. \n\n![Vanessa and I in Tsinghua Merch](/images/merch.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe went to the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Laboratory, were many individuals at HydoTech had done their PhDs, or were currently in the process of completing PhDs. Mr. Gu had mentioned that there had been a battery explosion not too long ago, so we saw the aftermath of that in the building without a roof. \n\n![Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Laboratory](/images/hydrogenlab.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nWe then moved on to walk by the dormitory that Mr. Gu's lived in during his studies here. We stopped to get coffee and warm up. I started realizing how cold it was outside, which contrasts strongly to my student life in California, where ever time I walk to class it is warm and sunny.\n\n\n## The Great Wall\n\nOur next stop was the Great Wall. We took the train to the Badaling section of the wall, which is the most popular section. It was very crowded, but it was still an amazing experience to see the wall in person. I had seen it in pictures and videos before, but it was still breathtaking to see it in person. The view from the top of the wall was incredible, and I could see for miles in every direction. It was a bit difficult to climb up, especially with the cold weather and my boots, but it was definitely worth it. I was surprised by how crowded it was, given it was a week day, but I think it just shows how popular and important the Great Wall is to people in China. \n\n![The Great Wall](/images/greatwall.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nMany people were reciting a poem about the Great Wall about the dragon, which I had never heard before. It was interesting to see how much the wall is celebrated and ingrained in the culture and history of China.\n\n\n## Dinner\n\nFor dinner, I met Dr. Yao, Dr. Hu, Dr. Su, Junming, and a future colleague of HydoTech called Sam. Sam graduated from Yale, and also spend some time in Cornell, so we had some common things to talk about from the US University system. I spoke with Dr. Su about his work and learned a lot about cooperation and developments in Europe. I was surprised by many different things that I learned, both from how different the US and Chinese developments in Hydrogen Energy are, to how much he recommended the French University system, to how slow he attributed processes in Europe due to beauraucracy. He also told me a lot about Ordos, which was interesting for me to learn before we departed the next morning. I had no idea that Ordos was such a wealthy city. Coming from the US, it was a city- and even province or area that I had never heard of before.\n\nThe dinner was Italian food, and I found this interesting because we were in the \"International Neighborhood\" of Beijing- where all the embassys are. \n\nIt was very nice to sit with everyone and observe company dynamics from a different perspective. Being in the Nanjing office up until now, I had only been around the people who work in that office, who are essentially everyone working under the people at the table now. So being at the table with everyone- especially Dr. Yao- was great to see the \"orchestrators\" of the company I had gotten to know up to this time. This is especially because, from my conversations with different employees in the Nanjing office, everyone seems genuinely so content with the leadership, company culture, and employment base. Moreover, understanding the deep ties that everyone at the table has to the university and understanding how their research and work overlapped before HydoTech was founded, was a great insight into the company and its roots.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Tsinghua University\n\nIn the morning, Vanessa, Mr. Gu, and I visited Tsinghua University at 8 AM sharp.
