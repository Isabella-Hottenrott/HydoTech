## Morning Work

In the morning, I continued with some code to analyze CVM data under different fault scenarios. These included: Short Circuit by Cable, Short Circuit by Lye, Diaphragm Damage, and Lye Starvation.

## To the Factory

Vanessa, Yutong, Sia and I headed out to the factory. Seeing the manufacturing setup was very interesting; I walked through the areas where the electrolyzers are built and the R&D rooms where they undergo rigorous testing. One of the most unique sights? The Hydrogen Bicycle.


## Team Building Games

HydoTech organized a massive game day for the workers, and I got thrown right into the mix. It was chaotic fun.

  * Galaibo: A classic game.

  * Ball Toss: Throwing and catching tennis balls as a squad.

  * The Counting Game: We had to count up as a team. (Proud to say I contributed by counting to four in Chinese!)

  * The Bamboo Run: Running across the road while holding onto a bamboo stick together.

Despite winning the first event, our team lost overall. But the vibes were high.

## Sweet Reward After

I then drove back to Nanjing with Sia and Yutong for a post-work treat: dumplings and milk tea at the mall. Sia introduced me to two different milk tea creations. Verdict: Delicious.
