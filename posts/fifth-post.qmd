## HydoTech Canteen

Research continued through the morning. At lunch, I hit a milestone: my first canteen noodles in China with Muyi. I had a delicious hot bowl of noodles with beef, perfect in the middle of a cold work day. It was a very inexpensive meal, which was overall impressing me across China: how affordable and accessible food is.

## Electrical Schematics

In the afternoon, I shifted gears to something more comfortable to me: Electrical Engineering.

I reviewed the schematics for the CVM controller sent by Mr. Gu. I connected the dots between the schematics and the system overview Mr. Gu had shown me earlier.

## Wrapping Up
To wrap up the day, I took the metro home— I always think public transport is the best way to learn the heartbeat of a new city.
