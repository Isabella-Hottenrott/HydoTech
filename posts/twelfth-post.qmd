## Travel Back to Nanjing

Vanessa and I woke up early the next morning- it was still dark outside. At the airport, I opted for a Mongolian Yogurt for Breakfast.

Once we landed, we returned back to Jinaye. I got an early lunch at the mall and then went into the office to concentrate and get a bit of work done. 

## Office

I hadn't had much time to do much work during our travels, so it was time for me to look back and see if any of the professors or researchers who I had reached out to responded. Up until now, only one professor had responded. His research was helpful and I had been able to draw conclusions from his work, but I wanted a larger variety of experiments to compare the deliverable that I had so far. Looking back into my inbox, a few other professionals had, and they provided me with some papers that they published that I didn't have access to before. Otherwise, I was provided with references or other professionals to reach out to. I spent the rest of the day reading through them and extracting whatever information was relevant for my purposes. It was nice to receive this response from professionals in the field, and it was a good reminder of how the academic community values collaboration and sharing of information. I hope to receive more responses in the coming days.

I returned home and started to put together my presentation for the next day. Before going to bed, I wanted to have all my slides outline so that I could practise presenting a few times in the morning.
