## Arrival at Airport

After a long travel lasting over 24 hours, I finally landed in Nanjing around lunchtime. Vanessa was there immediately to greet me and we drove straight into the city to the One Mall.

## One Mall

My first taste of local flavors were:

  * An Americano with Orange Juice from LuckyCoffee
  * Lunch of traditional local food. Most notably, some authentic Nanjing Duck.

## Dinner

After a much-needed power nap at the hotel, we met Mr. Gu for dinner. We tried cuisine from the Canton region. A perfect, savory end to a long travel day.
