## Arrival at Airport

After a long travel lasting over 24 hours, I finally landed in Nanjing around lunchtime. Vanessa was there immediately to greet me and we drove straight into the city to the One Mall.

## One Mall

It was my first time experiencing the mall culture in China. There are many big malls in cities, each with many stores. It is typical for people to go over the weekend. These malls are all much bigger than those in the US, and it seems to be much more of a culture to go to the mall, even just to walk around. The One Mall was a very nice mall, with many high-end stores.
My first taste of local flavors were:

  * An Americano with Orange Juice from LuckyCoffee
  * Lunch of traditional local food. Most notably, some authentic Nanjing Duck.

## Dinner

After a much-needed power nap at the hotel, we met Mr. Gu for dinner. We tried cuisine from the Hong Kong region. It was definitely different in flavor to the Jiangsu meal I had for lunch, showing how different all the flavors across China can be. It was a perfect, savory end to a long travel day.
