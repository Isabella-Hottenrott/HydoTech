## Field Trip

We drove out to the suburbs of Jiangsu to visit the motor controller manufacturing center. This was a heavy-hitting technical day. Before arriving at the manufacturing center, we had a delicious lunch from the region.

## Stop 1: The R&D Field Station

We saw a testbench for a big electrolyzer that the clients wanted Mr. Gu to take a look at. It’s quite a machine, consuming CO2 and recycling its own heat. Seeing technology with that kind of prospect for the future was inspiring.

## Stop 2: Manufacturing

We toured the assembly lines (a mix of full and partial automation) where they seal the controller PCBs. We walked through the vibration and environmental testing rooms—rigorous stuff.

## The CVM Test

Finally, we got our hands on the HydoTech CVM controller system I had studied the day before. Here is how the system flow worked:

  * Distribution: Test voltage leads to probes connecting to the electrolyzer substrate.
  * Conversion: Inside the controller, voltage is converted to a two-byte representation and biased upward (to avoid negatives).
  * Transmission: Transmission: Data is sent via two CAN ports $\rightarrow$ CAN-to-Ethernet gateway $\rightarrow$ Modbus conversion $\rightarrow$ Gateway.
  * Cloud: Over the router, data goes via 5G to the server.


We validated the real-time data on the computer using a multimeter.

## Panda Cake and Japanese

We returned to Nanjing for a dinner with the whole crew: Yutong, Yubo, Mr. Gu, Muyi, and Vanessa. Great company and excellent food, headlined by a green cake featuring edible pandas. The Japanese food served for dinner was also really great.
