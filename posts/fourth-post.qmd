## Morning Travels

I wanted to see the city before the hustle began, so I woke up at 5:00 AM. I wandered through Zhanyuan Park and along the Qinhuaihe River. Getting fresh air and seeing the quiet, historic side of Nanjing was a great reset button.

## Research Hurdle

Back at the office, the challenge ramped up. I was tasked with researching the stability of Nickel phases in an alkaline medium. This was a double-edged sword:

  * The Science: I’m new to electrochemistry, so the concepts were fresh.
  * The Toolset: I had to navigate the Chinese internet and Chinese AI tools.

I’m used to American web infrastructure, so suddenly not having my usual digital "crutches" made the learning curve steep. I spent the afternoon combing through references, line by line, paper by paper. One of my biggest curiosities was how the Chinese AI tools would perform when prompted in English and required to output an English answer. I am interested in looking this up later. I am not sure what the training process or training data is, and if it exludes English, how that affects performance. I wouldn't be surprised, though, if there was some mechanism found around this. This is all to say, though, that I used almost no AI for my project because:

  1- The prompting took very long. I had to keep reminding it to respond in English.
  
  2- I was not confident in the accuracy of the responses, given the language barrier and the fact that I was asking it to respond in a language that it may not have been trained on.
