## Jumping Right Into the New Year

Sunday was technically my first day in the office. Because of the three-day New Year break, the schedule shifted, meaning everyone was back at their desks today. I walked to work on my own, although it was thankfully a very short walk so I couldn't get lost.

## Onboarding

I got settled at my desk and spent the day absorbing HydoTech pamphlets—learning about the company’s massive footprint in China and globally—and reading a detailed BCG report on the Hydrogen Energy Industry to get the "big picture" view.
I learned about the different project completed or under completion at Hydotech and within China, related to Hydrogen energy. Notably, and perhaps more salient to an international crowd, the Beijing Olympics featured a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell buses. The torch in the Beijing Olympics was a hydrogen powered torch too.
