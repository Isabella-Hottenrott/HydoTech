I first looked into the different types of experimentation, to better understand what data was exactly being extracted- what exactly was being measured and by what means. These included Raman Spectroscopies, Cyclic Voltammetries, Pourbaix Diagrams, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopies. Once I had a better idea, I began writing down the different experimental conditions."
