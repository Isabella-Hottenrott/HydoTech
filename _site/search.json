I spent the afternoon combing through references, line by line, paper by paper. One of my biggest curiosities was how the Chinese AI tools would perform when prompted in English and required to output an English answer. I am interested in looking this up later. I am not sure what the training process or training data is, and if it exludes English, how that affects performance. I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if there was some mechanism found around this. This is all to say, though, that I used almost no AI for my project because:\n1- The prompting took very long. I had to keep reminding it to respond in English.\n2- I was not confident in the accuracy of the responses, given the language barrier and the fact that I was asking it to respond in a language that it may not have been trained on."

Their testbench was further away, and simply in the middle of some field. I was curious why this was the case, potentially that they didn’t want others taking their IP, but didn’t ask. Both Mr. Gu and the Gentleman from the manufacturing center studied in Aachen, and the two of them had the same advisor at Tsinghua University. I spoke a bit of German with this Gentleman.\nThe testbench is quite a machine, consuming CO2 and recycling its own heat. Seeing technology with that kind of prospect for the future was inspiring.\nThe region we drove through going back to the center was entirely industrial.

They also do all of their own PCB assembly which, for the amount of PCBs they assemble potentially makes sense, but is a whole new set of infrastructure and work that has to be accounted for. Then, all of the sealing of the controller PCBs and actual assembly. The Gentleman also informed me that they do all the software for the chips- which I can only imagine is a entire new undertaking, something a whole different company could rationally be hired to do.\nWe were also taken to another building where walked through the vibration and environmental testing rooms—rigorous stuff. As manufacturers of such products, you have liability for what you ship to be working. All of this testing needs to be accounted for as well."

    "text": "Further Research\nI continued my research into the phases of Nickel at 30 wt% KOH. I found different papers that took different approaches of experimentation to characterize the phases. Some were contradictory, leading me to look deeper into the conditions under which the experiments took place. I first looked into the different types of experimentation, to better understand what data was exactly being extracted- what exactly was being measured and by what means. These included Raman Spectroscopies, Cyclic Voltammetries, Pourbaix Diagrams, and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopies. Once I had a better idea, I began writing down the different experimental conditions.\nLater, I started realizing that I would need to progress in some other ways. I knew that I would be busy in the upcoming days with travel and sightseeing plans, and I wouldnt be able to understand everything about the mechanisms surrounding the evolution of Nickel species in the few days of work that I had remaining.\nAs I have previously mentioned, I wasn’t able to employ AI as well in this instance to arrive at a better understanding and be able to move forward in my research. I decided that the best way for me to make substantial progress and produce a meaningful deliverable for Mr. Gu was if I learned from professionals in the field. I started gathering a list of professors and researchers in the field of Nickel-based catalysts, and I reached out to them to ask for references that I might find useful in my research. Just writing the emails and collecting the list took me the whole rest of the day, but I was happy to have gotten started on this, and allowing them a bit of time to respond given the holidays."

Sam graduated from Yale, and also spend some time in Cornell, so we had some common things to talk about from the US University system. I spoke with Dr. Su about his work and learned a lot about cooperation and developments in Europe. I was surprised by many different things that I learned, both from how different the US and Chinese developments in Hydrogen Energy are, to how much he recommended the French University system, to how slow he attributed processes in Europe due to beauraucracy. He also told me a lot about Ordos, which was interesting for me to learn before we departed the next morning. I had no idea that Ordos was such a wealthy city. Coming from the US, it was a city- and even province or area that I had never heard of before.\nThe dinner was Italian food, and I found this interesting because we were in the “International Neighborhood” of Beijing- where all the embassys are.\nIt was very nice to sit with everyone and observe company dynamics from a different perspective. Being in the Nanjing office up until now, I had only been around the people who work in that office, who are essentially everyone working under the people at the table now. So being at the table with everyone- especially Dr. Yao- was great to see the “orchestrators” of the company I had gotten to know up to this time. This is especially because, from my conversations with different employees in the Nanjing office, everyone seems genuinely so content with the leadership, company culture, and employment base. Moreover, understanding the deep ties that everyone at the table has to the university and understanding how their research and work overlapped before HydoTech was founded, was a great insight into the company and its roots."

Most notably, some authentic Nanjing Duck.\n\n\n\n\nLunch Restaurant"

The restaurant was very small, and had a very local feel to it. The food was amazing. We ordered a bunch of different types of meat, and they were all so flavorful. This might have been my favorite meal during my time in China, just because the food was sooo good. It was a great way to end the day after being out in the cold for long.\n\n\n\nBarbeque in Beijing\n\n\nIt was also really great to be spending time with Vanessa and Mr. Gu. It gave me insight into my future work- I definitely aspire to have colleagues where I can have fun with them outside of work, and have a good relationship with them. I know that both of them work really hard and are very dedicated to their work, but it was nice to see that they also have fun together and can enjoy each other’s company outside of work. I think that is really important for a good work environment and culture."

We were able to go up several observation towers, but even going up to the top of the talles one, it was not possible to discern any part of the horse.\n\n\n\nSolar Panel Field NASA Observatory Image\n\n\nIt was very impressive to imagine the amount of power being produced, standing up there and not being able to see the end of all the infrastructure. There seemed to be multiple projects all around the area. The gentleman who took us up the observation tower told us that his company also had a 40 GW project nearby. That is equivalent to the entire US grid storage capacity. But this is contained in just a single solar PV project in China. From an American perspective, it was quite a shocking realization.\nWe then also decided to inspect the PV panels up close. There was snow on the ground, but during the summer, the land under the solar panels is used for agricultural purposes becuase the solar panels provide shade for the crops. Otherwise, the intensity of the sun would be too strong. At the backs of the panels, we looked at the electrical connections and determined that the ones we were looking at were not turned on at the time."

Because they were both facing forward at the time, neither of them realized, and the sand was flying over their heads. It was very funny to watch.\n\n\n\nMr. Gu and I Look Funny on the Bike\n\n\nWe then went on driving back through the desert landscape. It was beautiful. Other than the piles of sand, there was also bright red rock and some greenery. Once we arrived in an area closer to windmills, we decided to try to drive to their base and inspect them up close. We got to the base of one of the windmills, and it was really interesting to see how they were built. The shape- especially of the blades- was unqiue and intentionally designed. It was very loud standing right next to the moving blades, simply because of the amount of wind each wind was pushing past. This view once again gave an impression of how large-scale the energy industry is in China.\n\n\n\nWindmill\n\n\nBy the end of the day, I had seen the following energy infrastructure:\n\nSolar panels\nWindmills\nThe HydoTech testbench\nCoal mines from the airplane\nA dam from the airplane\n\nI am so grateful to have had the opportunity to see all of this in person, and to have a better understanding of the scale of the industry in China.\n\n\n\nSelfie in Front of the Windmill"

Then, we went and visited popmar and played some games in the games room. At Popmart there were SO many people. I was so surprised by how many people were obsessed with these little dolls that you couldn’t even choose to buy on your own.

None of us got the doll we wanted.\n\n\n\nPopmart Dolls\n\n\nNext, we went to play games in the pick-up hall. We bought 210 coins and only collected 7 dolls. We averaged ten tries per doll.

    "text": "Mr. Gu and I took an early morning train to Shanghai to go visit two suppliers. This was once again a demonstration of how much Dr. Yao and Mr. Gu were trying to expose me to the energy industry in China. It is such a privelege to first-hand see the cutting-edge developments within the field and get to ask whatever questions I want."

    "text": "Bipolar Metal Plates\nWe first went to a company that manufactures metal bipolar plates for hydrogen fuel cell applications. They use a pressing technology that is used in other applications- for example in the making of car doors- to press the pattern for the bipolar plates into the metal sheets. The precision that these technologies have is very impressive: 0.05 cm plate thickness and 0.03 cm engraving depth.\nWe saw a Hydrogen drone, which was very cool. It has a much longer lifetime than a lithium ion battery, and was said to manage operationality of up to three hours. It is mostly used for military and agricultural purposes because it can lift heavy loads.\n\n\n\nHydrogen Drone\n\n\nI then joined a meeting between Mr. Gu and the representative at this supplier. They kept the working language in Chinese, so I wasn’t able to understand much, but it was insightful to see how different players in this industry interact and form relationships with each other."

It was a sunny day and I was able to take a nice walk along the water.\n\n\n\nShangai Beach\n\n\nAt this point, I have now visited:\n\nA Chinese Desert\nA Chinese Beach\nThe Chinese Mountains\nMany Chinese Cities\nThe Chinese Countryside\n\nI felt like this was somewhat full circle, and it was a reminder of how grateful I am to have been exposed to so much during my truly short stay here."

    "text": "H-Rise\nI returned and met Mr. Gu. We took off for the next manufacturers: H-Rise. They focus on the develpment and manufacturing of fuel cell stacks. Because they have received traction from Investors and Government officials, they had a downstairs area that was dedicated to showcasing the technologies they have produced. As an outside perspective, this was an insightful way to digest the work done by the company and the different projects that they have in place.\nWe were taken through a few of their different test facilties. We saw a single 1.5 MW electrolyser, which was again so impressive for me to understand the scale of.\nSome of their tiny plates were subjected to 2.5 A per cm^2 flowing through them.\nOnce again, Mr. Gu and the gentleman we were visiting presented a slide deck to each other of their respective companies and work. This was another point of insight into industry interactions. Mr. Gu brought up the issue of electrode corrosion and asked the gentleman if he had ever seen or experienced something similar. This was a point that was so interesting to me- even though the both of them work at different companies within the same industry and would otherwise be seen as competitors, they were eager to support each other and move forward as a single effort. The gentleman thought hard and tried to provide genuine help for Mr. Gu’s corrosion issues.\nIt turned dark out as we left H-Rise. The car ride back to Shanghai was quite long, but it was nice to recap and digest everything I had seen with Mr. Gu."

Once in Nanjing, I packed my bags, grabbed a quick lunch, and headed to the airport. My connection flight was first to Seoul, and then I would be going from there to LA.\nSchool starts in two days, but I have had the most amazing experience here over the past two weeks. I am not sure how I will adjust back to being on my small campus, in my small university bubble after this experience."
